1. Coding Test implemented using Python

2. Have Python environment ready to execute

3. Code is reading input from one file and writing output to another file

4. Both code and respective input and output file contained in the same folder

5. LI_MissingLetters, input1.txt, output1.txt
	In file LI_MissingLetters.py,
	replace 'C:/Users/s528358/eclipse-workspace/LI_CodeTest/output1.txt' and 'C:/Users/s528358/eclipse-workspace/LI_CodeTest/input1.txt'
	with the location of output1.txt and input1.txt on the computer running the code
	
6. LI_Animation, input2.txt, output2.text
	In file LI_Animation.py,
	replace 'C:/Users/s528358/eclipse-workspace/LI_CodeTest/output2.txt' and 'C:/Users/s528358/eclipse-workspace/LI_CodeTest/input2.txt'
	with the location of output2.txt and input2.txt on the computer running the code
	
7. from the command line
	python LI_MissingLetters.py
	check the output1.txt file for output
	input1.txt can be changed (double quotes not allowed in the input)
	
8. from the command line
	python LI_Animation.py
	check the output2.tx file for output
	input2.txt can be changed (double quotes not allowed in the input)
